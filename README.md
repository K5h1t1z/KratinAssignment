### Description

- I have created a web based application. An HTML page to allow new user to sign up with 
the benefits and store their data in the database.
-The Schedule class gets an arraylist of the String from the database  which contains the email of the registered user,
and provide them with a schedule along with a reminder through mail.
- for the Email,I have used the java mail API along with a gmail account to send email to the registered user
- The email provided to them contains the task for the elder people to complete which keeps them active,
- provide them with a proper Schedule everyday through mail.
- The timer Class and TimerTask Class object allows the mail to be send at specific time to maintain the timing of the schedule.
-The Screenshot of the email are given below:
